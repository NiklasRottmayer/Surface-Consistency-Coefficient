# Synthetic-Data

This repository contains data tables of calculated quality metrics for a set of 20 different synthetic images generated by using Boolean models (30%-70% density) and random packings (10% density).
For each geometry a set of synthetic segmentations introducing systematic errors was calculated for error rates ranging betwen 1% and 15% in 1% increments. Afterwards a series of traditional quality metrics based on distinguishing between true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) are calculated. This includes well-established examples such as accuracy, Dice coefficient, Jaccard index or Matthews correlation coeffient. In addition to traditional metircs, distance-based metrics are added to which our own proposition can be attributed.
